# Notes:
# - Mark things SAFE if they're kid-friendly
# - Mark things BAD if they contain inappropriate language, personal info, or unsafe content
# - Even censored swear words (with numbers/symbols) should be marked BAD
# - Pyx learns from these examples to filter content automatically
#
# IMPORTANT BOUNDARY:
# - Normal frustration/self-criticism = SAFE (e.g., "I'm so stupid", "I messed up")
# - Self-harm/suicidal content = BAD (e.g., "I want to kill myself", "I want to die")
# - Racist/discriminatory language = ALWAYS BAD (even if censored)
